#Write a function that takes as input number of dice and number of sides. The function will then return a list
#of randomly generated numbers in the proper count and range. For example if the the function is asked to generate
#3D6 or three sixed sided dice, then a potential output would be [2,2,6]
#This function cannot have any input or print statements.
#Write supporting code that will as the user for number of dice and sides, call the function, then report the results.
#The function should not be called if number of dice is zero or less and instead should report bad input to the user
#The function should not be called if number of sides is 1 or less and instead should report bad input to the user
